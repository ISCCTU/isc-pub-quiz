# ISC Pub Quiz
A script to generate ISC Pub Quizzes as an HTML presentation. The quiz is defined using a YAML file, which is then passed to a Python script. Using `jinja2` and `pyyaml`, an HTML file is generated. The presentation uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for interactivity. As of right now, the asset folder is necessary to show the presentation properly.

## TODO:
* improve layouts & make it look better in general
* support audio questions
