                <li>Once per game, before the last round of questions, you can get an extra point if the whole table orders a Pivovice (or a non-alcoholic alternative if you don't drink).</li>
                <li>Please do not use internet, phones, etc. â€” it ruins the game for others.</li>

                <li>In case of disagreements, the organizers have the final word.</li>
